This project is based on the [C^3-Framework](https://github.com/gjy3035/C-3-Framework) and [NPWU-Crowd-Sample-Code](https://github.com/gjy3035/NWPU-Crowd-Sample-Code) on which the models were trained:
- (C-3-Framework): Gao, Junyu and Lin, Wei and Zhao, Bin and Wang, Dong and Gao, Chenyu and Wen, Jun, [C^3 Framework: An Open-source PyTorch Code for Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02724), arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.02724, (2019)

This repo also contains some samples from various dataset:
